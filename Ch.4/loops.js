// Because the presence of an object or array can be considered truthy,it is often used to check for the existence of an 
// elemlent within a page. 
// as soon as a truthy value is found, the remaining options are not checked. Experienced programmers often:
// 1. Put the code most likely to return true first in OR operations and false answers first in an AND operation

// Keywords often seen in loops (and sometimes functions):
// 1. break - this Keyword causes the termination of the loop and tells the interpreter to go onto the next statement of code
// outside of the loop
// 2. continue - this keyword tells the interpreter to stop the current iteration and then check the condition again (if its
// 	true, the code runs again)
